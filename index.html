  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-10">
      <p>Nano C effectively nullifies the problem of having to hold your phone and 
        eliminates any usage of cords through wireless charging. That means if someone 
        wanted to listen to music on their iPhone 7 or better (or another phone that uses
        the charging port and a dongle for headphones) they could charge their phone and 
        still be able to use their headphones. The nano suction technology enables users 
        to stick he/she phone anywhere. For example, when on the road, users can easily 
        put he/she phone on their windshield without having the obstruction of another 
        phone attachment. Another example is when the user is watching a video while 
        cooking, he/she does not have to place his/her phone in an area where the phone
        may potentially become damaged or worsened. Additionally, there will be no adhesive 
        substances left behind as there is with tape and sticky notes. Instead of utilizing
        adhesives, we, as a group, decided to apply mechanical suction. This mechanical 
        suction technology  If an individual were to take a group picture, but there was
        no one else around, they could easily stick their phone to a nearby flat wall or
        structure. Our case solves many everyday problems essentially combining two unique
        ideas to become the best. </p>

  <h3 class="text-center">What Other People Think:</h3><br>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-10">
      <p>To test the marketability of our product, we conducted a survey with over 60 
        respondents. From our data, we gathered that most people, around 60% of the 
        respondents, were tired of carrying their phones for long periods of time or
        when they were busy doing something else as well. This data means that the nano 
        suction feature on our phone case would be marketable because it would allow 
        the user to place their phone on a vertical surface such as a wall without it 
        falling. This means the user can free the hand holding the phone in order to 
        work on other tasks. One question that many of the respondents have asked is 
        if our phone cases will accidentally stick to pockets. However, nano suction 
        only attaches to non-porous surfaces such as walls and as a result, the porous
        pocket will not become stuck to the phone case. Another problem that the users 
        feared would happen, was the phone case would be very hard to remove from the
        wall. However, this will not occur with our case because of a simple property 
        in physics. The vacuum created by the phone case is strong enough to lift itself
        and the phone in the process. An easy way to remove the phone from the wall is 
        to simply peel the phone off from one corner, pulling towards you and perpendicular
        to the wall. Air will rush it because of diffusion and the vacuum will be lost.  
        Therefore, there is no need to worry about the phone case getting stuck in a 
        pocket because a pocket is too porous for the phone to attach.
